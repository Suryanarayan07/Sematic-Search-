# Sematic-Search-
This project analyzes semantic search performance by comparing two embedding models  (SigLIP and MPNet) on the NFCorpus medical dataset. Using MAP@25 as the evaluation  metric, we identify retrieval errors through False Positive and False Negative  analysis, providing insights into model limitations and recommendations for improvement.
